# 🎞️ Animation Workshop
Hands on exercise to learn how to implement animations in SwiftUI using Lottie Files and PhaseAnimator.

## ⬇️ Installing Lottie SDK to Xcode:

1. In Xcode, select “File” → “Add Packages Dependencies…”
2. Enter https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-spm.git

## 🗂️ Accessing LottieFiles and getting free animations:

1. Access: https://lottiefiles.com/featured-free-animations
2. Login to your account on LottieFiles, configure your workspace by clicking on “My Dashboard” (Make sure you have a project folder so you can save the animations to).
3. Go to the free featured page and select an animation you would like to use.

For this exercise we will use two specific animations, each in a different format for demonstration:

Download:
- Lottie JSON: https://lottiefiles.com/free-animation/完成动画-nKnq6P2G7R
- dotLottie: https://lottiefiles.com/free-animation/confetti-on-transparent-background-ajhx1TPBa7

4. Save to your folder.
5. Open the animation and download the desired format (.json or .dotLottie).

After that, simply drag the downloaded files to your project to add them and you can start implementing.
